    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of
      this recipe card, this was a family favorite.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the
        center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the
        griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges
        are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with
        remaining batter.
      </li>
    </ol>
