        In a nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat until foamy. Add eggs and cook,
        stirring and scrambling gently with a silicone spatula, until large, fluffy curds form and

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>
      <em>
        We like to season our eggs with salt at about 1% of their weight, or about 1.5g for 3 large
        eggs (though we rarely actually measure it out in practice). Just note that not only do
        different eaters have different salt-level preferences, but the volume of a given weight of
        salt itself will vary dramatically by brand, so season at your own discretion.
